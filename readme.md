Hey you, what's up?

Here is the Dr.Agent code that we have discussed on The Age of Agentic AI Event.

Don't forget that you should create a .env file and add a Tavily API key under the name "TAVILY_API_KEY"

And you must also have a Gemma LLM run locally(just kidding üòÅ)

If you don't have a Gemma model being run locally (which you probably don't), you can simply modify the structure of the code for another LLM model (by API) like Gemini or ChatGPT.

Enjoy trial and learning with this code, hope you get good ideas ‚ö°
