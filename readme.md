Hey, You
Here is the Dr.Agent code that we have discussed on The Age of Agentic AI Event.
Don't forget that you should create a .env file and add a Tavily API key under the name "TAVILY_API_KEY"
and also create have a Gemma LLM run locally 😁
if you don't have one, you can simply modify the structure of the code for trial and learning purposes
